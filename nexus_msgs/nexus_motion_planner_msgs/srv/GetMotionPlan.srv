# Scaling factors for optionally reducing the maximum joint velocities and

# acceleration specified in the robot model are multiplied by their respective
# factors.  If either are outside their valid ranges (importantly, this
# includes being set to 0.0), the factor is set to the default value of 1.0
# internally (i.e., maximum joint velocity or maximum joint acceleration).
